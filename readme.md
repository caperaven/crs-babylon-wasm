# CRS BabylonJs Wasm

## Introduction
This is still a work in progress, I want to create a template that encapuslates some BabylonJs features in web assembly using Rust.  
There are a number of performance and related tests I want to run where the development is focused on the rust side but calling into BabylonsJs

Once completed it will be made into a template as a quick starter.  

## Primary aim
Use multithreading where one thread updates the UI while another does data processing and updates the meta data used to render from.
