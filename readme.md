# CRS BabylonJs Wasm

## Introduction
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how to create rust code that uses babylonjs as a render engine.
It is not a extensive exposure of all of babylon featueres but only what is required for this project.
It does however show you enough to expose the parts that you might need.

## Compile the wasm
run the build command in the rust folder
```wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../bin```
